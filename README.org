Slightly opinionated default Emacs configuration

* About
This repository provides reasonable defaults of which to build a
personal Emacs configuration off.  It aims mainly to expose some of
the sticking points and non-obvious configurations that new users
might want to change.  While most of the configuration here will be
valuable to almost all users, they are slightly aligned with the
author's preferences.
